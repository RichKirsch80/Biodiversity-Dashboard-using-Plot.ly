Goals - Belly button biodiversity dashboard answers the question, what microbes colonize human navels. Dashboard displays microbial species that are present in more than 70% of people. Using Plot.ly the dashboard displays top 10 microbial species, bubble chart displaying each sample,  demographic info for selected individual and gauge for selected individualâ€™s frequency of belly washing.

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, 
while the rest were relatively rare.

Used the D3 library to read in samples.json.

Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Created Demographic info panel for each individual selected.

Created gauge for each individual selected based on frequency of belly button washing.

Mapped data and charts to interactive dashboard html.
